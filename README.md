# Project Name
- Unwind

## Objective
- This project is part of GA's projects and aim to develop a webapp using React.

## Game Description
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are Hachi, your friend is Jerry. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Project Status
- Project is Complete.
- However, I believe that there's always room for improvement so feel free to hit me up with your new ideas.

## Room for Improvement
Some areas that I want to improve are:
- Allow user to choose their player
- Keep record of the win and draw
- Game styling
- Music background
